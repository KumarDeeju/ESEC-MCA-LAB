                    I have 10 years of experience in all sorts of graphic design: logo, print, web, motion. For the last 5 years I specialise mainly in the fields of UX/UI and digital signage. I successfully tried different roles in the field: leading in-house designer, part of the design team, art director in agency, freelancer.
